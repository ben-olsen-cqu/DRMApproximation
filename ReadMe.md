##Direct Rainfall Model Approximation
#Final Year Engineering Thesis

This program has been created to accept inputs from a TUFLOW Rainfall on Grid model and delineate catchments and calculate hydrographs using the Time-Area Method hydrological method.

These outputs are intended to be used to check the calibration and verify the outputs of the DRM approach used by TUFLOW.
